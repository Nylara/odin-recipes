<h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>a mugful of American long grain rice</li>
        <li>a cupful of frozen peas</li>
        <li>2 tbsp sunflower oil<li>
        <li>2 back bacon rashers, roughly chopped</li>
        <li>1 small red pepper chopped</li>
        <li> garlic cloves thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 heaped tsp Chinese five-spice powder </li>
        <li>spring onions shredded</li>
    </ul>


<h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Fill a roomy saucepan with water, bring to the boil and tip in a heaped teaspoon of salt - the water will bubble furiously. Pour in the rice, stir once and return to the boil, then turn the heat down a little so that the water is boiling steadily, but not vigorously.</li>
        <li>Boil uncovered, without stirring (this makes for sticky rice) for 10 minutes. After 8 minutes, throw in the frozen peas, boil for 2 minutes and drain (donâ€™t rinse).</li>
        <li>Heat the sunflower oil in a wok and stir fry the bacon for 3-4 minutes until crisp. Tip in the red pepper and the garlic cloves and stir fry for 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Beat the eggs, pour into the pan and stir fry until the egg just sets. Toss in the Chinese 5-spice and the rice and peas. Top with the shredded spring onions.</li>
    </ol>
